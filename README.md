# TIETGRAM_SocialNetworkingApp


PROJECT OVERVIEW

While there are many types of social media sites for use, the Thapar University will have an official app called TIETGram.  TIETGram is a domain oriented app that will allow users to share information, upload their posts, connect with friends and also get access to centralized Notice board where faculty and administration can display important notices, timetable, Academic calendar, Exam notice etc. Societies can showcase their upcoming acitivities and current events. Our app will have Home Page, Feed, Search Page, Notice Board, Map, Settings and Link Page. All these features will help Thaparians in easy managing of their daily activities.




SCOPE OF THE PROJECT

The goal is to design proprietary social media software for TIET. Our software will cater to all the basic needs of students, Alumni, Administration and faculty. We will provide privilege to administrative and faculty members by tagging system. In this system, the users will be able to upload their posts, connect with friends and also get access to centralized notice board. We will also implement an authentication system to provide security to our software. Our software will cater the flexible needs of users to access the software from any device.  We will also implement map to help 1st year students navigate with ease.
